      JBossWS is based on the <ulink url="http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossmc">JBoss Microcontainer</ulink>, which
      supports direct POJO deployment and standalone use outside the JBoss application server. Currently, we have integration 
      layers for the JBoss application server and Apache Tomcat.
