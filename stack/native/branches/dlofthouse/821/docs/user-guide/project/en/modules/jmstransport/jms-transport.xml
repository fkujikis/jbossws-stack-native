  <title>JMS Transport</title>
  
  <para>JBossWS supports J2EE-1.4 message driven beans (MDB) as service endpoints. 
    A JMS message that is targeted to MDB may contain a SOAP envelope that is then dispatched to the same MDB. 
    The MDB implements the methods on the Service Endpoint Interface (SEI), onMessage() is implemented 
    by a base class that we provide.
