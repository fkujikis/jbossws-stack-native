  <para>To take advantage of optimum integration it is best to install JBossWS on the appserver with embedded Tomcat. 
    In this way you get access to the full set of advanced J2EE features (JMS, JAAS, EJB, etc.) advanced class loading,
    better integration with managment and security. Contrary to common believe JBossAS with embedded Tomcat is 
    as lightweight and easy to administer as standalone Tomcat.</para>

  <para>The integration layer hooks into the JBoss deployer architecture and allows you to hot-deploy POJO and EJB endpoints. The
  packaging of a standard portable J2EE-1.4 web service endpoints is defined by the JSR109 specification. JBossWS also supports
