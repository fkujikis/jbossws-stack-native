      JBossWS is our new implementation of J2EE compatible web services. This document describes the design principal
      and objectives of the JBoss SOAP stack that we aim to be part of the JBoss-5.0 release.
    </para>
    <para>
      Within the JBoss-4.x series we have a J2EE-1.4 compatible Web Service (WS4EE) implementation that relies on a
      modified version of the Apache Axis-1.1 release. JBossWS is targeted to replace the Axis based SOAP implementation
      with a solution that fits better in the overall JBoss architecture and is suitable for the specific Web Service
      requirements in J2EE.
