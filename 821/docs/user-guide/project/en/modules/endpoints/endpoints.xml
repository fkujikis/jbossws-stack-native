    <title>Developing web service endpoints</title>
    <para>
        In the previous chapter we have seen how to package and deploy simple endpoints
        that were all based on POJO implementations. If you really want to leverage J2EE technologies
        it might be more appropriate to use EJB endpoint implementations. In this chapter we will use EJB-2.1 
        and EJB-3.0 stateless session beans and explore the
        <ulink url="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=181">Web Services Metadata specification</ulink>,
        which allows you to expose classes as a webservice through the use of JDK 5 annotations.
