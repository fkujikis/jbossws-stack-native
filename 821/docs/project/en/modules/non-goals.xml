  <title>Non-Goals</title>

  <para>
    The following are non-goals.
  </para>

  <para>
    <command>SOAP Encoding Support</command> Use of the SOAP encoding is essentially deprecated in the web services
    community, e.g., the WS-I Basic Profile excludes SOAP encoding. Instead, literal usage is preferred,
    either in the RPC or document style.
  </para>

  <para>
    <command>Support for Java versions prior to J2SE 1.5</command> JAX-RPC 2.0 relies on many of the Java language
    features added in J2SE 1.5. It is not a goal to support JBossWS on Java versions prior to J2SE 1.5.
  </para>

  <para>
    <command>Service Registration and Discovery</command> It is not a goal of JBossWS to support registration and
    discovery of services via UDDI or ebXML RR. This capability is provided independently by JAXR.
  </para>
